## 👋 Hey, I'm Nekena Rabeharivonjy
**Student at 42 Antananarivo | Passionate Software Developer | Creator of Innovative Projects | Full-Stack JavaScript Developer**

🎓 I’m currently studying at **[42 Antananarivo](https://42antananarivo.mg/)**, where I’m sharpening my skills in both **system programming** and **web development**. With a solid foundation in C, Shell scripting, and JavaScript, with a focus on theoretical computer science and process management. I’ve also gained valuable experience in **system administration** and plan to explore **cybersecurity** in the future.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Interests
- **Languages**: C/C++, Shell, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB
- **System**: Low-level C development, Shell scripting, multithreading, process management
- **Current Focus**: Full-stack JavaScript development, backend systems, and diving into cybersecurity 🔒

## 💡 Featured Projects
Here’s a glimpse of some of the projects I’ve worked on:

- **[fanorona-server](#)**: Developed a multiplayer server in **JavaScript** for the traditional Malagasy strategy game **Fanorona**, focusing on real-time interaction and game logic.

## 🏛️ 42 Cursus Projects
All my projects from the **[42 Antananarivo](https://42antananarivo.mg/)** program are organized and documented in the **[42-cursus](#)** repository. Here you’ll find projects ranging from system-level programming challenges to more complex tasks involving algorithms, data structures, and operating systems.

## 🔒 Web Development and Future Goals
Alongside system development, I am deeply interested in web technologies. I’m currently honing my skills in **full-stack JavaScript development** and look forward to building dynamic web applications. As I grow as a developer, I plan to explore **cybersecurity**, combining my knowledge of system architecture with security principles to tackle real-world challenges.
